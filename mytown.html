       <h2 style="color:green;">History</h2>
       <p> The first Russian settlement in the area dates from 1718, when Russia built a fort beside the river Irtysh, near the ruins of an ancient Buddhist monastery, where seven buildings could be seen. The fort (and later the city) was named Semipalatinsk (Russian for "Seven-Chambered City") after the monastery. The fort suffered frequently from flooding caused by snowmelt swelling the Irtysh.</p>
